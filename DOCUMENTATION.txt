4. DATABASE SCHEMA
==================

TABLE: jokes

| Column      | Type                | Description                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| id          | INTEGER PRIMARY KEY | Auto-incrementing unique identifier               |
| type        | TEXT                | Joke category (general, programming, knock-knock) |
| setup       | TEXT                | The joke question or setup                        |
| punchline   | TEXT                | The joke answer or punchline                      |

SAMPLE DATA:
INSERT INTO jokes (type, setup, punchline) VALUES
('general', 'What did the fish say when it hit the wall?', 'Dam.'),
('programming', 'Why would a guitarist become a good programmer?', 'He''s adept at riffing in C#.');

===============================================================================

5. API DOCUMENTATION
====================

ENDPOINT: GET /api/joke/random

PURPOSE: Retrieve a random joke from the database
METHOD: GET
URL: /api/joke/random
RESPONSE FORMAT: JSON

RESPONSE EXAMPLE:
{
  "id": 42,
  "type": "general",
  "setup": "What did the fish say when it hit the wall?",
  "punchline": "Dam."
}

ERROR RESPONSE:
{
  "error": "Database error message"
}

===============================================================================

6. FRONTEND ARCHITECTURE
========================

STATE MANAGEMENT:
The frontend uses simple state variables:
- currentJoke: Stores the currently displayed joke object
- punchlineRevealed: Boolean tracking if punchline is visible

USER INTERACTION FLOW:
1. Initial Load: Automatically fetches and displays a random joke
2. First Click: Reveals the punchline with animation
3. Second Click: Loads the next random joke
4. Keyboard Support: Space/Enter keys trigger same actions

ERROR HANDLING:
- Network request failures show user-friendly error messages
- Loading states prevent multiple simultaneous requests
- Graceful degradation when API is unavailable

===============================================================================

7. DATA FLOW
============

1. APPLICATION STARTUP:
   User runs npm start → server.js starts → Express server listens on port 3000

2. DATABASE INITIALIZATION:
   User runs node import.js → Reads data/index.json → Creates SQLite database → Imports all jokes

3. JOKE REQUEST FLOW:
   User visits page → HTML loads → JavaScript executes → API call to /api/joke/random → Database query → JSON response → Display joke

4. USER INTERACTION FLOW:
   User clicks → Check punchlineRevealed state → Show punchline OR Load new joke → Update UI → Update state

===============================================================================

8. SETUP & INSTALLATION PROCESS
===============================

PREREQUISITES CHECK:
- Node.js version 14+ required
- npm package manager (included with Node.js)
- File system write permissions for database creation

INSTALLATION STEPS:
1. Dependency Installation: npm install downloads all required packages
2. Database Setup: node import.js creates database and imports jokes
3. Server Startup: npm start launches the Express server
4. Access Application: Navigate to http://localhost:3000

FILE PERMISSIONS:
- ./db/ directory must be writable for SQLite database creation
- ./public/ directory serves static files

9. COMMON QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
=============================

GENERAL QUESTIONS:

Q: What is this application?
A: A web-based joke viewer that displays random jokes from a database. Users can click to reveal punchlines and navigate through jokes.

Q: How many jokes are in the database?
A: The application includes over 2,000 jokes across different categories (general, programming, knock-knock).

Q: Can I add my own jokes?
A: Yes, you can modify data/index.json and re-run node import.js to update the database.

Q: Is this a production-ready application?
A: This is a demonstration/learning project. For production, you'd want to add authentication, rate limiting, and security measures.

TECHNICAL QUESTIONS:

Q: Why use SQLite instead of a larger database?
A: SQLite is perfect for this use case - it's lightweight, requires no server setup, and stores data in a single file. Ideal for small to medium applications.

Q: How does the random joke selection work?
A: The SQL query ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 1 uses SQLite's built-in random function to select one random row from the jokes table.

Q: Why not use a frontend framework like React?
A: This project demonstrates vanilla JavaScript capabilities. For larger applications, frameworks would be beneficial for state management and component reusability.

Q: How is the punchline animation implemented?
A: CSS transitions and transforms are used. The punchline starts with opacity: 0 and transform: translateY(20px), then animates to opacity: 1 and transform: translateY(0).

Q: What happens if the database is corrupted?
A: The application will return a 500 error. In a production environment, you'd want proper error handling and database backup strategies.

DEVELOPMENT QUESTIONS:

Q: How do I modify the styling?
A: Edit public/styles.css. The app uses modern CSS with flexbox, gradients, and animations.

Q: How do I add new API endpoints?
A: Add new routes in server.js using Express.js routing methods (app.get, app.post, etc.).

Q: How do I change the port number?
A: Set the PORT environment variable or modify the default in server.js (currently 3000).

Q: How do I deploy this application?
A: You can deploy to platforms like Heroku, Vercel, or any Node.js hosting service. Remember to set up the database on the server.

PERFORMANCE QUESTIONS:

Q: Is the application fast?
A: Yes, SQLite is very fast for this use case. The database is small and queries are simple.

Q: How does it handle concurrent users?
A: SQLite handles read operations well, but for high concurrency, you'd want a more robust database like PostgreSQL.

Q: What about caching?
A: Currently no caching is implemented. For production, you could add Redis or in-memory caching.

SECURITY QUESTIONS:

Q: Is this application secure?
A: Basic security measures are in place (CORS), but for production you'd want input validation, rate limiting, and HTTPS.

Q: Can users inject SQL?
A: No, the application uses parameterized queries which prevent SQL injection attacks.

Q: What about XSS attacks?
A: The application doesn't accept user input, so XSS risk is minimal, but proper output encoding should be implemented for production.

TROUBLESHOOTING QUESTIONS:

Q: The app won't start - what's wrong?
A: Check if Node.js is installed, dependencies are installed (npm install), and port 3000 is available.

Q: No jokes are showing - what to do?
A: Ensure you've run node import.js to populate the database, and check that ./db/jokes.db exists.

Q: Database errors occur - how to fix?
A: Delete ./db/jokes.db and re-run node import.js to recreate the database.

Q: Styling looks broken - why?
A: Check that public/styles.css is accessible and the server is serving static files correctly.
